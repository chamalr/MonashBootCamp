Homework Week 3.

Step 1.
1.	sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student$ mkdir Lucky_Duck_Investigations
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student$ ls
day1  day2  day3  Lucky_Duck_Investigations
2.	sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ mkdir Roulette_Loss_Investigation
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ ls
Roulette_Loss_Investigation
3.	sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ mkdir Player_Analysis
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ mkdir Dealer_Analysis
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ mkdir Player_Dealer_Correlation
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations$ ls
Dealer_Analysis  Player_Analysis  Player_Dealer_Correlation  Roulette_Loss_Investigation
4.	sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Player_Analysis$ touch Notes_Player_Analysis
$ touch Notes_Dealer_Analysis
$ touch Notes_Player_Dealer_Correction

Step 2.
1.wget "https://tinyurl.com/3-HW-setup-evidence" && chmod +x ./3-HW-setup-evidence && ./3-HW-setup-evidence
2. $ mv 0310_Dealer_schedule 0312_Dealer_schedule 0315_Dealer_schedule ../Dealer_Analysis/
    $ mv 0310_win_loss_player_data 0312_win_loss_player_data 0315_win_loss_player_data ../Player_Analysis/



Step 3.- Complete the player analysis. 
2. /03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Player_Analysis$ grep '\-$*' *
3. $ grep '\-$*' * > Roulette_Losses
4. sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Player_Analysis$ more Roulette_Losses

The time of the losses occurred on each day
$ awk '{print $1,$2}' Roulette_Losses > Notes_Player_Analysis
If there is a certain player that was playing during each of those times
Save this below #!/bin/bash content in bash script file and run as below give the output of most frequent word of the file.

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Player_Analysis$ bash Most_Seen_Player_name.sh 
output is 13 Mylie Schmidt.

The total count of times this player was playing

According the bash output its Mylie Schmidt is playing in 13 times.

Step 3.-Complete the dealer analysis. 
3. each day and time that you determined losses occurred. I wrote a script call “output.sh” and ran the “output.sh” and created the Dealers_working_during_losses file. You can find the date, Time, am/pm, first name of the roulette dealer and the last name of the roulette dealer in Dealers_working_during_losses file. 

Then I wrote a script to find out the dealer who is working in a specific date and time. But you need to pass the argument like below.

$ bash roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh 0312 04 pm the out put for this is Cleveland Hanna.

According to the question example the player is working on March 10 at 2 pm is:
$ bash roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh 0310 02 pm
Billy Jones (the answer is Billy Jones). 
 
4.
Then from the “Dealers_working_during_losses” file, I cut out the Dealers names 
From the following command. 
$ awk '{print $4,$5}' Dealers_working_during_losses &> Dealer_names



5.	Now I have dealer’s data in Dealer_names file. 

To find the primary dealer working at that times where losses occurred, I wrote a bash script like below name Primary_dealer_working_at_that_time.sh after running this script I get the output as 15 times and the Dealer is Billy Jones.

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Dealer_Analysis$ bash Primary_dealer_working_at_that_time.sh
     15 Billy Jones


6.	Input these sentences to the file “Notes_Player_Dealer_Correction”.
Used nano editor to write below sentences in to above file.

there is a certain player that was playing during each of the losses occurred, her name is Mylie Schmidt. She was playing in 13 times.
there is a primary dealer working at the times where losses occurred, his name is Billy Jones. He has seen in 15 times.
That means Player Mylie Schmidt and Dealer Billy Jones are doing some scam to the Lucky Duck.

Step 4.
1.
I have all the data in “Dealers_working_during_losses” file. The data is like below.
0310 12:00:00 AM Marlene Mcpherson
0310 01:00:00 AM Saima Mcdermott
0310 02:00:00 AM Abigale Rich

I wrote a script to find the Roulette Dealer call “roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh”.
I can run above file using below command.

$ bash roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh 0312 05 pm ( “0312” “05” “pm” are the three arguments)
Then the output comes as below.
Rahima Figueroa

The bash command are as below for the  “roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh” file

#!/bin/bash
grep -w $1 Dealers_working_during_losses > a.txt
grep -w $2 a.txt > b.txt
grep -wi $3 b.txt | awk '{print $4,$5}' 
rm a.txt b.txt

2. 
I have test the  “roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh” file and its giving me the correct output.

For bonus Question. 
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Dealer_Analysis$ useful data is in all the three files.
1.	0310_Dealer_schedule
2.	0312_Dealer_schedule
3.	0315_Dealer_schedule

I wrote a script call bonus.sh to get the output.
When you pass the parameters to bonus file you need pass as below. 
Specific date: 0310, 0312 or 0315
Specific time: 04 pm, 06 PM, 05 Am, or 03 am (am, pm are not case sensitive)
Casino game being played: Black, Roulette or Texas. (The fourth parameter is case sensitive) As an example, you can pass parameters as “Bla”, “Rou” or “Tex” even. 

	$ bash bonus.sh 0315 06 pm Texas or $ bash bonus.sh 0310 06 am Black these two commands give me the dealer names as “John-James Hayward” and ”Evalyn Howell” respectively.
